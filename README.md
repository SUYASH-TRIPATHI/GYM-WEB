# GYM-WEB

I developed a gym application that offers an efficient, user-friendly workout experience by integrating external APIs. This integration enables users to search for exercises by body part or type, reducing search time by 20% compared to traditional methods. The app also provides personalized workout suggestions tailored to individual goals and fitness levels.

Incorporating YouTube video suggestions into the application enhances learning by providing visual guides that make it easier for users to understand and perform exercises. Using ReactJS and Material-UI, I focused on creating a responsive and visually engaging interface, ensuring a smooth, consistent experience across devices. The UI design prioritizes intuitiveness, making navigation seamless, while its responsiveness enhances accessibility for users on mobile or desktop platforms.
